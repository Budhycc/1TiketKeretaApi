Application: 1TiketKeretaApi (Train Ticket Booking System)

Executable JAR: dist/1TiketKeretaApi.jar

Initial Screen:
- Login screen with "Username" and "Password" fields.
- Authentication is done against an `admin` table in the database.

Main Navigation Elements (after login, in the `Home` window):
- Ticket booking form with various input fields.
- Menu bar:
  - "File" menu:
    - "Admin": Leads to an admin section.
    - "Keluar": Exits the application.
  - "Data Penumpang" menu: Leads to a passenger data viewing section.

Apparent Core Features:
1.  Login: Authenticates users (presumably administrators).
2.  Ticket Booking:
    - Passenger details (ID, name, address).
    - Station selection (start and destination).
    - Train and carriage selection.
    - Date selection.
    - Number of adult/child passengers.
3.  Price Calculation: Dynamically calculates ticket prices based on selected options (likely from a `harga` database table).
4.  Ticket Generation: Saves booking to `penumpang` table and generates a ticket report (`Tiket.jasper`).
5.  Admin Panel (`Admin.java`): Accessed via "File" -> "Admin" menu.
    - Admin User Management:
        - Add, view, edit, and delete admin users (data stored in `admin` table).
        - UI: Input fields for name, username, password; JTable for display; Save, Edit, Delete buttons.
    - Price Management:
        - View and edit ticket prices (data stored in `harga` table).
        - Prices are categorized by "Status" (e.g., adult/child) and "Kelas" (carriage class).
        - UI: JTable for display; fields for status, class, price (price editable); Save button.
6.  Passenger Data Viewing (`Penumpang.java`): Accessed via "Data Penumpang" menu.
    - View all passenger booking records from the `penumpang` table in a JTable.
    - Columns include ID, name, address, train, carriage, destination, departure/arrival times, date, adult/child counts, and total price.
    - Print Passenger Report: Generates a JasperReport (`penumpang.jasper`) of all passenger data.
    - Delete All Passenger Data: Clears the `penumpang` table after confirmation.

Technical Notes:
- The application is a Java Swing GUI application.
- It uses a MySQL database (requires `mysql-connector-java` driver).
- Database connection details are handled in `tiket.Koneksi`.
- Main application logic after login is in `tiket.Home`.
- It uses JasperReports for ticket and passenger list generation.
- Running the JAR directly in a headless environment throws `java.awt.HeadlessException`. Exploration was done by analyzing the source code.
- The application seems to have a fixed start station: "Bandung (BD)" in the booking form.
- Default train options: "Argo Wilis", "Argo Parahyangan", "Lodaya".
- Default carriage options: "Eksekutif 1/2", "Ekonomi 1/2/3".
- Prices for adults and children are fetched based on carriage class from the `harga` table.
- The `bayangan1` JTextField in `Admin.java` is used as a hidden field to store the ID of the currently selected item in tables for update/delete operations.
- Navigation between main sections (Home, Admin, Penumpang) is done by creating new JFrame instances and disposing of the current one.
- The `Admin` and `Penumpang` sections also have menu options to navigate to other sections or exit.
